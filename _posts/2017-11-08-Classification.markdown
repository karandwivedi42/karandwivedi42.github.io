I am reading more about diverse topics, so I completely lost track of the grandfather problem: Imagenet Classification. I foud out that ILSVRC 2017 was the last IN competition. Also there were a number of interesting new papers.

This is a list of the "classification architectures" in winning approaches.

### 1. Dual Path Network

- [Slides](http://image-net.org/challenges/talks_2017/ilsvrc2017_DPNs.pdf)

### 2. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks

- [Slides](http://image-net.org/challenges/talks_2017/SENet.pdf)

### 3. Deep Pyramidal Residual Networks

- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02915.pdf)

### 4. Residual Attention

- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06904)

### 5. ResNeXt

- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431)
